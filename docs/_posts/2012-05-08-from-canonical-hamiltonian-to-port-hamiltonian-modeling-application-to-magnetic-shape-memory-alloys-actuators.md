## Abstract
This paper presents the modelling of an actuator based on Magnetic Shape Memory Alloys (MSMA). The actuation principle relies on the ability of the material to change its shape under the application of a magnetic field. Previous models proposed by authors were based on canonical (symplectic) Hamiltonian modeling and thermodynamics of irreversible processes. These models, though physically cogent, are non-minimal differential algebraic dynamical models and hence less adapted for control purposes. This paper therefore proposes a modified and system-oriented modeling procedure which lends itself naturally to a port-Hamiltonian model. The latter is found to be a minimal realization of the above whereby interconnection between subsystems is clearly visible. Using Lagrange multipliers, constraints which arise due to causality and interconnection are expressed. In the last section, Differential Algebraic Equations (DAE) resulting from previous models are reduced to Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) and by using coordinate transformations, constraints are decoupled from the system input/output. The resulting model is well-suited for control.
