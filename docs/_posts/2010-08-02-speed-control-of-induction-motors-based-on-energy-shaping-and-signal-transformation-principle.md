## Abstract
Applying a novel control method of the Port-Controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) systems with dissipation, the modelling and speed tracking control of induction motor is presented when load torque is known and unknown. A PCH model of induction motor is established. The induction motor and controller are interconnected, and desired closed-loop PCH system structure is obtained by the feedback control. The desired closed-loop Hamiltonian function is given. The controller and load torque observer are designed. The equilibrium stability of the closed-loop system is also verified. Using SVPWM signal transformation method, speed regulation of induction motor is implemented by controlling the duty ratio of every converter switch. The simulation results show the system has good load disturbances attenuation and good speed tracking performances.
