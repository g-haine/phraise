## Abstract
In order to improve the performance of the rectifier under unbalanced voltage condition, this paper adopts port-controlled Hamiltonian dissipation (PCHD) control strategy. On the basic of the mathematical model of the three-phase voltage source PWM rectifier, its PCHD model in synchronous dq coordinates was established by orthogonal transformation. The desired equilibrium point of the system was obtained according to the target of the design. The controller was designed with the method of interconnection and damping assignment, and the PI control method was introduced to restrain the steady-state error of DC side. Simulation results show that the designed control system has perfect static and dynamic performances and robustness.
