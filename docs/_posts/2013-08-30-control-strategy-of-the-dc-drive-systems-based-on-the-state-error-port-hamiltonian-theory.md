## Abstract
A novel state error port-controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) system method is presented for speed control the direct current (DC) separately excited motor. The unity power factor regulation of three phase pulse width modulated (PWM) rectifier is also implemented. Then, the state error PCH system control theory, the PCH model of the PWM rectifier and DC motor are proposed. Moreover, the control algorithm of the duty ratio switch function is presented for the PWM rectifier. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the controller has good speed tracking and unity power factor control performances.
