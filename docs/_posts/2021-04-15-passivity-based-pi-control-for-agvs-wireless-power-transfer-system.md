## Abstract
Automatic guided vehicles (AGVs) recently have gained increasing attentions and applications, however, frequently stopping to recharge largely reduces service efficiency. Wireless power transfer (WPT) is considered as a practice energization way to solve this problem. In this paper, a passivity-based controller (PBC) and parameter designing method for compensation topology are proposed for AGVs WPT system. The PBC based on port-controlled Hamiltonian system (PCHS) is designed to achieve desired constant systematic working power by regulating the output voltage of DC/DC converter. The LCC-LCC resonant network is analyzed in the principle of the impedance matching method, and a proportional integral (PI) controller is implemented to realize zero steady-state error. Simulation are carried out in PLECS to verify analysis, and results show that proposed controller scheme and compensation designing method ensure the stability of the charging system against load variations, and the fast response performance of the control algorithm is also validated.
