## Abstract
In this paper, a new approach is successfully addressed to design the optimal controller of the port controlled Hamilton (PCH) system. The expected energy of the PCH system is shaped into the value function satisfying the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, where the method of interconnection and damping assignment is applied, and the expected energy is derived by exploiting the matrix decomposition approach. It is shown that the proposed method has many potential advantages for both theory and application of the optimal control of the PCH systems such as, instead of solving partial differential equations, the matching conditions in the optimal control become a set of algebraic equations. In practice, the discussed method is used to the optimal control of the induction motor for electric vehicle, and the simulation results are provided to validate the concepts.
