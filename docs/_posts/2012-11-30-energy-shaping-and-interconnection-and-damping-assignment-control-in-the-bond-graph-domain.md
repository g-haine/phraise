## Abstract
This paper presents an interpretation in the Bond Graph domain of the Energy Shaping and Interconnection and Damping Assignment control methods, developed for the well-known Port-Controlled Hamiltonian Systems with Dissipation. In order to have a stable equilibrium at a prespecified state, the energy function is modified by adding storage elements to the BG such that the closedloop system energy has a minimum at that state. A new dissipation function is assigned changing the R-field and its interconnection with the rest of the Bond Graph. A desired power conserving interconnection structure is reached through the suitable insertion of power bonds among junctions. Energy shaping, interconnection and damping assignment are performed in a so called Target Bond Graph. The control law is determined by a set of partial differential equations derived from the plant and the Target Bond Graph.
