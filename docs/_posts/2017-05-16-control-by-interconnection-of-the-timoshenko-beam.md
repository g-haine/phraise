## Abstract
In this paper, the dynamical control of a mixed finite and infinite dimensional mechanical system is approached within the framework of port Hamiltonian systems. As an applicative example of the presented methodology, a flexible beam, modeled according to the Timoshenko theory, with a mass under gravity field connected to a free end, is considered. After the distributed port Hamiltonian (dpH) model of the beam is introduced, the control problem is discussed. The concept of structural invariant (Casimir function) is generalized to the infinite dimensional case and the so-called control by interconnection control technique is extended to the infinite dimensional case. In this way, finite dimensional passive controllers can stabilize distributed parameter systems by shaping their total energy, i.e. by assigning a new minimum in the desired equilibrium configuration that can be reached if a dissipation effect is introduced
