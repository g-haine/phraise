## Abstract
This paper presents a high-performance nonlinear controller for Switched reluctance machine (SRM), acting as a speed regulation motor drive. We use a cascaded torque control structure for torque ripple minimization. In a cascaded control structure, accurate torque control requires inner current controller. Passivity-based control (PBC) approaches is proposed for current control purpose. By using the port-controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) systems theory, a full-order nonlinear controlled model is first developed. Then nonlinear passivity-based adaptive sliding mode control algorithm in the presence of external disturbances for the purpose of torque ripple reduction and characteristic improvement is presented. The proposed controller design is separated into the inner loop and the outer loop controller. In the inner loop, passivity-based control (PBC) is employed by using energy shaping techniques to produce the proper switching function. The outer loop control is employed by adaptive sliding controller to determine the appropriate Torque command. It can also overcome the inherent nonlinear characteristics of the system and make the whole system robust to uncertainties. The performance of the proposed controller algorithm has been demonstrated in simulation and also experimentally using a 4KW, four-phase, 8/6 pole SRM DSP-based drive system.
