## Abstract
The port-Hamiltonian formalism is a very powerful tool for describing dynamical systems and their interconnections and for designing control laws with specified energetic properties. In this paper, in particular, it is shown how a variable structure control can be designed in this general framework in order to achieve a passive systems with, additionally, the robust properties obtainable with variable structure systems. Simulation results obtained with a 2-dof manipulator are reported and discussed in order to validate the proposed approach.
