## Abstract
A method of port-controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) systems energy-shaping control is presented for the four-quadrant control problem of squirrel cage induction motor (IM) drive system. First, the PCH models of IM drive system are developed. Then, the PCH controllers are designed based on the control theory of closed-loop state error PCH system. The coordinated control of the grid-side and the motor-side are applied in Matlab/simulink, which the motor-side is started after the grid-side is achieved up to stable. The controlled system can be achieved that DC bus voltage controllable, unity power factor, energy bidirectional flow, IM run in the four-quadrant, etc.
