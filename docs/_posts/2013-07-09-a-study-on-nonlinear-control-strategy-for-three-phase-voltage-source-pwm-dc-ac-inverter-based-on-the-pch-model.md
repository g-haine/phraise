## Abstract
The mathematical model of a three-phase voltage source pulse-width modulation (PWM) DC/AC inverter is non-linear, and in view of the traditional linear control strategy it can not meet the requirements of designing a high-performance inverter. Whatâ€™s more, when the loads are not pure resistive loads, the inverter further requires that the controller possess high-performance. This paper proposes a nonlinear control strategy for the inverter called Passivity-based Control. We can alter the inverter model in three-phase abc coordinate to two-phase synchronous rotating dq coordinate for establishing the port-control Hamiltonian (PCH) model for this system. We can control the distribution of energy in the system to achieve the control aim. Simulation results show that the passivity-based control method can make this system possess a level of high-performance that is both robust and dynamic.
