## Abstract
In order to improve the properties of AC/DC converters, scholars in different countries have began to apply nonlinear control theory based on storage function to AC/DC converters. For this purpose, this paper introduces the study status of three-phase AC/DC voltage-source converters based on storage function, which includes Lyapunov control theory, passivity control theory using Euler-Lagrange (EL) model and port controlled Hamiltonian with dissipation (PCHD) model, and proposes a new design method of passivity controller based on EL model of AC/DC converter. Meanwhile this paper analyzes the nonlinear control strategies above.
