## Abstract
Currently, light electric vehicles are rapidly developing in various kinds. To power these vehicles with batteries, the simplest electric drive system is a DC motor controlled by a DC-DC converter. This work utilizes a bidirectional Zeta-SEPIC DC-DC converter with an integrated DC motor. This implementation enables control of motor speed and torque in traction and regenerative braking modes. Additionally, it allows for the use of a lower voltage battery compared to the motor's rated voltage, reducing battery weight and increasing safety. In this work, a decomposition approach is applied. Two separate port-controlled Hamiltonian subsystems are obtained to adjust the motor angular velocity in the traction (Zeta) and braking (SEPIC) modes of the DC-DC converter. The Passivity-Based Control (PBC) method is used to synthesize the drive control subsystems in these modes. This method is based on the energy laws of processes in systems and provides asymptotic stability of nonlinear systems, in this case, two fourth-order subsystems for speed control. Two third-order current control subsystems synthesized by the PBC were used to limit the motor current at a given level. The synthesis resulted in sets of possible structures of control influence formers (CIFs) for all PBC subsystems using Zeta and SEPIC DC-DC converters. The study analyzed the operation of the obtained structures of the CIFs, selected the most effective ones, and determined the laws of adaptation of their parameters to the value of the motor angular velocity through computer simulation in Matlab/Simulink. The results of the simulation showed that the drive operated well in both static and dynamic modes.
