## Abstract
We consider the problem of (asymptotic) stabilization of mechanical systems with underactuation degree one. A state-feedback design is derived applying the interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control methodology. Its application relies on the possibility of solving a set of partial differential equations that identify the energy functions that can be assigned to the closed-loop. The following results are established: 1) identification - in terms of some algebraic inequalities - of a subclass of these systems for which the partial differential equations are trivially solved; 2) characterization of all systems which are feedback-equivalent to this subclass; and 3) introduction of a suitable parametrization of the assignable energy functions that provides the designer with a handle to address transient performance and robustness issues. An additional feature of our developments is that the open-loop system need not be described by a port-controlled Hamiltonian (or Lagrangian) model, a situation that arises often in applications due to model reductions or preliminary feedbacks that destroy the structure. The new result is applied to obtain an (almost) globally stabilizing controller for the inertia wheel pendulum, a controller for the chariot with pendulum system that can swing-up the pendulum from any position in the upper half plane and stop the chariot at any desired location, and an (almost) globally stabilizing scheme for the vertical takeoff and landing aircraft with strong input coupling. In all cases we obtain very simple and intuitive solutions that do not rely on, rather unnatural and technique-driven, linearization or decoupling procedures but instead endows the closed-loop system with a Hamiltonian structure with desired potential and kinetic energy functions.
