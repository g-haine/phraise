## Abstract
An electromagnetic one-dimensional transmission line represented in distributed port-Hamiltonian form is lumped into a chain of subsystems whi preserve the port-Hamiltonian structure with inputs and outputs in collocated form. The procedure is essentially an adaptation of the procedure for discretization of Stokes-Dirac structures presented in (Clemente-Gallardo et al., 2002), that does not preserve the port-Hamiltonian structure after discretization. With some modifications essentially inspired on the finite difference paradigm, the procedure now results in a system that preserves the collocated port-Hamiltonian structure along with some other desirable conditions for interconnection. The simulation results are compared with those presented previously in (Golo et al., 2002).
