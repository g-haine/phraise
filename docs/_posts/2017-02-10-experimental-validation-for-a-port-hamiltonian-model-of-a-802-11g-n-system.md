## Abstract
A port-Hamiltonian model of the traffic dynamics for a wireless communication system was developed in our previous work. The developed model takes into account various wireless communication aspects: such as a wireless path loss model, the characteristics of a wireless communication system, mac layer and network layer protocols, antenna design, latencies, buffer dynamics, acknowledgment rate and so on. In the OSI model of seven layers, the main layers responsible for the flow and control of traffic are the MAC layer and the Network layer. The model was developed based on the operation of these two layers. In this paper, we provide an experimental validation of the previously developed port-Hamiltonian model, in an indoor wireless network test bed. We demonstrate, that the analysis of the theoretical model agrees with the experimental data. This work is the first to provide an experimental demonstration of port-Hamiltonian models developed for wireless communication systems.
