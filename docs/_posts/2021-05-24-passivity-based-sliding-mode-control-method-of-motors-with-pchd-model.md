## Abstract
High-performance control of induction motors has always been an important research direction in field of nonlinear control. The passivity-based control (PBC) method has brought a new solver to the globally stable controller design problem of nonlinear induction motor. The aim of this paper is to develop a control algorithm to realize asymptotically tracking of flux and speed under unknown time-varying load torque, and repress the tracking error caused by the stator and rotor resistance changes. To achieve this, a port-controlled Hamiltonian with dissipation (PCHD) model of induction motor is built, and a nonlinear feedback PBC method, combined with sliding mode control, is proposed. From the energy point of view, the inductor motor control system is analyzed and the “workless forces” is determined, which does not have any effect on the energy balance equation of the closed control system. This leads to a simple control structure with nonexistence of singularity and enhances the robustness of the control system. The reasonability and validity of the proposed method is testified by the experimental results based on dSPACE.
