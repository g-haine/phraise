## Abstract
The energy-shaping controller design technique is adopted to asymptotic speed regulation of permanent magnet synchronous motors. The dynamical system is viewed as energy-transformation device, which is particularly useful in studying complex nonlinear system. In this article, the PCH (port-controlled Hamiltonian) speed control model of PMSM is established. The speed controller, satisfying the maximum output power control theory, is proposed using energy-shaping principle. The resulting scheme consists of a state feedback to which a load torque observer is added to estimate the unknown load torque. The stabilization analysis of equilibrium is presented as well. Simulation results show that the control strategy proposed in this paper gives satisfactory performance both at steady state and during transients.
