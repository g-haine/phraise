## Abstract
The mathematical model of three-phase voltage sources Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) rectifier is nonlinear, in view of the traditional linear control strategys weak disturbance-rejection ability with resistive and inductive load, a new passivity-based control strategy was proposed according to passivity-based control theory. Energy shaping method based on PCHD (Port Control Hamiltonian with Dissipation) model and the IDA-PBC (Interconnection and Damping Assignment Passivity Based Control) control algorithm is adopted to design passivity-based controller, which is able to make the energy function have the minimum value when rectifier is at the desired point, thus improving the stability and the load disturbance-rejection ability. Simulation results show that passivity-based control method can make this system possess the high-performance of robustness and dynamic.
