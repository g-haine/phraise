## Abstract
Wind farms connected to series-compensated transmission lines have the risk of sub-synchronous oscillation (SSO). The most effective countermeasure against SSOs is to identify the primary cause and then eliminate it. However, it is challenging for existing measurement-based methods to locate SSO sources accurately and timely. To solve this problem, we propose a location method based on the Hamiltonian system theory for identifying the SSO source. Considering the electromagnetic transient process, an energy function for power systems with DFIGs is constructed using the Hamiltonian system theory. The SSO port energy is obtained based on the energy function, and then the SSO source location can be identified by determining the direction of the total SSO port energy flow of a sub-system. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through case studies. The results show that the disturbance source can be located accurately in the forced SSO scenario, and the participation of DFIGs can be evaluated based on the port energy in the negatively damped SSO scenario.
