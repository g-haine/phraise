## Abstract
A mobile inverted pendulum robot is expected to be applied a which used in human living space and personal mobility. In this study, we propose nonlinear controller for accelerating driving the system with interconnection damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC). Although deriving IDA-PBC an underactuated difficult, show that dynamics of can properly described as full actuated port-Hamiltonian derived. The proposed guarantees asymptoic stability angle desired one large stable region. This leads based on relation between translational acceleration arising from instability system. approach realize various controllers have properties through energy shaping effectiveness verified simulations.
