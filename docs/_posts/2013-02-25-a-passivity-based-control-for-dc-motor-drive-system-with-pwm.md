## Abstract
This paper investigates a passivity-based control (PBC) for DC Motor drive system with PWM. In the paper, the port-controlled Hamiltonian system with dissipation (PCHD) model of the system is built and the interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC) method is used for the design of the controller. The system simulation model is built based on MATLAB/Simulink and the simulation results validate that the DC Motor drive system based on PBC controller has excellent dynamic performances such as robustness and transient response, compared with the traditional PI controller.
