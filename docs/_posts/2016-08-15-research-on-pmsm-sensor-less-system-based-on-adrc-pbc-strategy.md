## Abstract
The paper proposes a control strategy which combines Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) and Passivity-Based Control (PBC) for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) sensor-less system. The Port-Controlled Hamiltonian with Dissipation (PCHD) model of PMSM is established, which uses the method of Interconnection and Damping Assignment PBC (IDA-PBC). Adjust the parameters of the current regulator to improve the robustness of the system. To reduce the steady-state error, the ADRC speed regulator is applied to the strategy. To estimate rotor speed and position, Model Reference Adaptive System (MRAS) method is adopted. The results of simulation show that the application of ADRC-PBC control strategy on sensor-less system of PMSM provides smaller steady-state error, better anti-jamming ability and better system dynamic performance.
