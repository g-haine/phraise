## Abstract
Broadcast is one of the most important approach in distributed memory parallel computers that is used to find a routing approach from a one source to all nodes in the mesh. Broadcasting is a data communication task in which corresponds to one-to-all communication. Routing schema is the approach that used to determine the road that is used to send a message from a source node to destination nodes. In this paper, we propose an efficient two algorithms for broadcasting on an all-port wormhole-routed 3D mesh with arbitrary size. In wormhole routing large network packets are broken into small pieces called FLITs (flow control digits). The destination address is kept in the first flit which is called the header flit and sets up the routing behavior for all subsequent flits associated with the packet. If the packets of the message canâ€™t deliver to their destination and there is a cyclic dependence over the channels in the network, then the deadlock even is occurred. In this paper we introduce an efficient two algorithms, Three-Dimension Hamiltonian Broadcast (3-DHB) and Three-Dimension Six Ports Hamiltonian Broadcast (3-DSPHB) which used broadcast communication facility with deadlock-free wormhole routing in general threedimensional networks. In this paper the behaviors of these algorithms were compared using simulation. The results presented in this paper indicate that the advantage of the proposed algorithms.
