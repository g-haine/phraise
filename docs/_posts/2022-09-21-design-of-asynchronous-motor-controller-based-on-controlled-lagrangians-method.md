## Abstract
Asynchronous motor system has the characteristics of high order, strong coupling, and nonlinearity. From the dynamical model, it is the underactuated mechanical system, which means that the dimension of its input space is fewer than the degree of freedom. Following this perspective, the energy based nonlinear control technology-CL (controlled Lagrangians) method is used to solve the control problem in this paper. Based on the expected controlled energy and its derivative with respect to time, controlled Lagrangians and generalized force are constructed, and they produce the controlled equations. In order to ensure the complete matching between the controlled equation and the original equation, the gyroscopic forces containing the first-order term of velocity are innovatively introduced into the generalized force, and the matching conditions are obtained. By solving the matching conditions composed of some partial differential equations, the nonlinear smooth feedback control law can realize the global asymptotic stabilization of not only velocity but also position. Finally, the controlled energy is selected as the Lyapunov function, and the stability is proved according to the LaSalle invariant theorem. The effectiveness of the designed control law is demonstrated in the results of the simulation.
