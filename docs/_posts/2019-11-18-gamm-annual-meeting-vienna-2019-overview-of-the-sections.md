## Abstract
Volume 19 (2019) of PAMM “Proceedings in Applied Mathematics and Mechanics” assembles the contributions to the 90th Annual Meeting of the Gesellschaft für Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik (GAMM), organized on February 18–22, 2019 by Technische Universität Wien, Austria.The contributions are grouped according to the minisymposia and sessions of the conference.Overview of the SectionsGAMM related DFG Priority ProgrammesDFG–PP 1748 Reliable Simulation Techniques in Solid Mechanics.
