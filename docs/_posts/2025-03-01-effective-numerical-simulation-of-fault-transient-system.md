## Abstract
 Power systems, including synchronous generator systems, are typical systems that strive for stable operation. In this paper, we numerically study the fault transient process of a synchronous generator system based on the first benchmark model. That is, we make it clear whether an originally stable generator system can restore its stability after a short time of unstable transient process. To achieve this, we construct a structure-preserving method and compare it with the existing and frequently-used predictorâ€“corrector method. We newly establish a reductive form of the circuit system and accelerate the reduction process. Also a switching method between two stages in the fault transient process is given. Numerical results show the effectiveness and reliability of our method.
