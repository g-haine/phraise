## Abstract
Introduction. This paper presents a robust nonlinear control of the DC-DC boost converter feeding by a photovoltaic system based on the passivity control. The control law design uses the passivity approach. Novelty. The novelty consists in designing a control law for a photovoltaic system using a passivity approach based on energy shaping and associated with damping injection. Purpose. The purpose consists to develop a tool for design and optimize a control law of the photovoltaic system in order to improve its efficiency under some conditions such as the variations of the temperature, the irradiation and the parameters. Also, the control law design should be simple with a lower overshoot and a shorter settling time. Methods. This work uses the port Hamiltonian mathematical approach with minimization of the energy dissipation in boost converter of the photovoltaic system to illustrate the modification of energy and generate a specify duty cycle applied to the converter. Results. The results with MATLAB/SimPowerToolboxÂ® have proven the robustness against parameter variations and effectiveness of the proposed control. Practical value. The experimental results, carried out using a dSPACE DS1104 system, are presented to show the feasibility and the robustness of the proposed control strategy against parameter variations.
