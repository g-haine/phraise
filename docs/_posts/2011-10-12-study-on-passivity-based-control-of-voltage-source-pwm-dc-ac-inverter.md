## Abstract
The mathematical model of Three-phase Voltage Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) DC/AC inverter is non-linear, in view of the traditional linear control strategy can not meet the requirements of designing high-performance DC/AC inverter, this paper propose a new nonlinear control strategy for this called Passivity-based Control. We can alter the inverter model in three-phase abc coordinate to two-phase synchronous rotating dq coordinate for establishing port controlled Hamiltonian with dissipation (PCHD) model for this system. In view of this method, we can control the output energy of the system. Usually, we can use Single Chip Microcomputer or other kinds of computer with this algorithm for our design, this algorithm can be programmed with the computer language, such as C/C++ and assembly language, etc. Simulation results show that passivity-based control method can make this system possess the high-performance of robustness and dynamic.
