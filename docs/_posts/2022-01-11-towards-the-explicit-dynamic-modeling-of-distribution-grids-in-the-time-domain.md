## Abstract
The majority of monitoring and control applications at a distribution system control center rely on the assumption that the distribution network is in quasi steady-state. Known limitations of the quasi steady-state assumption are its inability to capture fast transients and harmonic distortion. Both of them are induced by the large-scale integration of distributed energy sources (DES) and power electronics. This motivates a dynamic modeling of distribution grids since such an approach naturally obviates the steady-state assumption. In the literature, the dynamic modeling of distribution networks mainly leads to implicit models in forms of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). In contrast, the explicit modeling in terms of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) has received limited attention. This is a problem as the model-based design of a controller and state estimator usually requires an explicit model. In this paper, we present a first approach towards a dynamic description of an unbalanced distribution grid by an explicit ODE model. A minimal system consisting of two buses and one three-phase three-wire line is considered. The contribution is twofold: first, we propose a time-domain dynamic model for the minimal system in form of an explicit Port-Hamiltonian system; secondly, the dynamic model is validated through experiments. The results show that the dynamic model can deal with both, fast transients and harmonic distortion.
