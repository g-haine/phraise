## Abstract
This study explores an application of robust nonlinear control to an underactuated inverted pendulum system (UIPS), a type of underactuated mechanical system, by first transforming the perturbed system into a form of a port-controlled Hamiltonian system (PCH), then utilizing the Interconnection and Damping Assignment Passivity-Based Control (IDA-PBC) methodology to achieve the stabilization of an unperturbed closed-loop PCH system with an assigned energy function that qualifies as a Lyapunov candidate at the unstable equilibrium point. From there, the problem of robustification of IDA-PBC for a perturbed closed-loop PCH system with the state-dependent input matrix of the UIPS, subject to constant matched disturbances, is addressed by adding an outer-loop controller with an additional state. This results in a new system that preserves the framework of a PCH system, rejects the disturbance, and has a new energy function that again serves as a Lyapunov function at the desired equilibrium point. This proposed methodology is called integral IDA-PBC (iIDA-PBC). The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method are thoroughly assessed through numerical simulations and experimental validation on the UIPS. The results demonstrate the method's proficiency in handling the systemâ€™s constant matched disturbances and model inaccuracies, underscoring the potential of iIDA-PBC for broader applications in systems facing similar control challenges.
