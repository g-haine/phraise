## Abstract
The analysis and control of nonlinear systems is still an important and active area of research. This book, in its third edition, has not strayed from the roots of earlier editions. The text still provides a comprehensive presentation of L2-gain and passivity theory from both the input–output and state-space viewpoints, connected through the dissipative systems framework. Additionally, this book is still a prime reference for energy shaping, nonlinear passivation via state feedback, nonlinear factorizations, and nonlinear H∞ control. However, this new edition includes various rewritten chapters as well as the addition of new material. Specifically, the chapter on dissipative systems in the second edition is now three separate chapters on dissipative systems theory, passive state-space systems, and L2-gain theory. The chapter on port-Hamiltonian systems (PHSs) in the second edition was split into two chapters on PHS theory (Chapter 6) and control of PHSs. The third edition has 11 chapters, compared to eight chapters in the second edition. A  of each chapter is given next. The book is an excellent reference for both students and researchers. The expansion of the text in the forms of Chapters 3, 4, and 6–8 makes the material more complete and accessible. This text is sure to continue to be one of the go-to references for nonlinear control researchers and practitioners interested in both the classical and modern interpretations and applications of L2-gain and passivity methods for nonlinear systems.
