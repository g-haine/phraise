## Abstract
This chapter presents a novel control strategy for trajectory tracking of underwater marine vehicles that are designed using port-Hamiltonian theory. A model for neutrally buoyant underwater vehicles is formulated as a PHS, and then the tracking controller is designed for the horizontal plane-surge, sway and yaw. The control design is done by formulating the error dynamics as a set-point regulation port-Hamiltonian control problem. The control design is formulated in two steps. In the first step, a static-feedback tracking controller is designed, and the second step integral action is added. The global asymptotic stability of the closed loop system is proved and the performance of the controller is illustrated using a model of an open-frame offshore underwater vehicle.
