## Abstract
Formation control of multiple unmanned surface vessels faces complex and changing environments and mission requirements, and the realization of efficient and complex formation control and the reduction of energy consumption have become key issues that need to be urgently addressed. In order to enhance system optimization, a state error port control Hamiltonian approach is employed to develop a Fourier-based controller for multiple unmanned surface vessels. It uses truncated Fourier series approximation curves and their finite coefficients to describe the shape of the curves in a state-error-port Hamiltonian framework. It automatically assigns multiple unmanned surface vessels to each of the formation control systems. The numerical and experimental results indicate that this approach not only simplifies the formation control process but also significantly reduces energy consumption. The algorithm has good tracking performance for closed boundaries of complex shapes, providing a novel and effective solution for complex formation tasks.
