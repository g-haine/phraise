## Abstract
The full speed range stabilizing control of interior permanent magnet synchronous motor(IPMSM)for electric vehicles based on Port-Controlled Hamiltonian(PCH)theory is proposed in this paper. First, the Hamiltonian stabilizing control of IPMSM is realized using energy-shaping method of interconnection and damping assignment. Then the desired equilibrium is acquired by maximum torque per current(MTPA) and field-weakening control. Finally, the load torque observer is designed and the controller design is developed when the load torque is unknown. The simulation results show that the proposed method has good speed tracking performance and anti-disturbance ability in the full speed range, and the theory contributes to the improvement of control performance in the electric vehicle.
