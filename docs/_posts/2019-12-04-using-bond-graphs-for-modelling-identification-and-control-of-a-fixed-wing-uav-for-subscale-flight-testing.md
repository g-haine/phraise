## Abstract
Subscale flight testing requires control and identification of unmanned aerial vehicles, in turn, these two aspects both require a competent dynamic model of the system. This work uses the port-based Bond Graph graphical modeling framework to model and simulate the dynamics and aerodynamics of a fixed wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). This model is used to design a total energy compensated based controller (TECS) and to perform system identification using the Output Error Method (OEM). The platform of this work consists of two UAVs, a subscale model of a BAE Hawk fighter jet and a commercially available drone, the Vector-P. These UAVs are used to determine the aerodynamic derivatives and compare these with simulations, wind tunnel and real airplane data. Proper subscale flight testing requires repetitive steady flight conditions, which can only be properly realized using a stabilizing autopilot. The multidisciplinary nature of UAVs make them especially suitable for modeling using bond graphs, a universal domain-independent energy and port- based modeling framework. The explicit representation of energy in bond graph modelling matches very well with TECS control and provides valuable insights in controller operation and opens new doors to future UAV controlling techniques based on Port Hamiltonian systems.
