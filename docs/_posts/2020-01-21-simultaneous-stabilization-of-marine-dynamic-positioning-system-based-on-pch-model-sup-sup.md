## Abstract
This paper studies two dynamic positioning ship systems’ simultaneous stabilization problem. The Hamilton function method is used to study the issue of simultaneous stabilization with unknown disturbance, and the related controllers are designed. First of all, we transform the dynamic positioning ship model into port controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) model, and the general simultaneous stabilization conditions are developed. Based on which, by adding the external interference, the robust controller is designed. Finally, the simulation results are tested by an illustrative example, which is shown to meet the expected requirements, and prove the rationality of the designed controller.
