## Abstract
This study investigates the stability of a bioprocess model that incorporates mass balance principles within a sequential reactor system equipped with a recycling loop. The analysis employs one-dimensional partial differential equations, including integro-differential terms, to evaluate exponential stability via a Port-Hamiltonian control mechanism. The proposed approach demonstrates how a simplified structural framework, used to estimate the carbon dehydration process within a dynamic model, enables seamless integration of carbon transfer control strategies across domains. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the modelâ€™s effectiveness and real-world applicability.
