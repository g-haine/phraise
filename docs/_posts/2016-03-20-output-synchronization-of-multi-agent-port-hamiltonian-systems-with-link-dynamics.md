## Abstract
In this paper, the output synchronization control is considered for multi-agent port-Hamiltonian systems with link dynamics. By using Hamiltonian energy function and Casimir function comprehensively, the design method is proposed to overcome the difficulties taken by link dynamics. The Hamiltonian function is used to handle the dynamic of agent, while the Casimir function is constructed to deal with the dynamic of link. Thus the Lyapunov function is generated by modifying the Hamiltonian function of forced Hamiltonian systems. Then, the proposed approach is applied in multi-machine power systems, which are interconnected in microgrid with power frequencies as link dynamics. Finally, the simulation result demonstrates the effectiveness of the gotten method.
