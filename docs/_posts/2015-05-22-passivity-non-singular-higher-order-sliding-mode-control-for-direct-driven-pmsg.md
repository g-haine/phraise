## Abstract
The paper firstly establishes a port-controlled Hamiltonian dissipation (PCHD) based model of a direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous generator (D-PMSG). A new double loop control of the D-PMSG is proposed with the outer speed loop controlled by a non-singular higher-order terminal sliding mode (NHTSM) controller to undertake maximum wind power point tracking (MPPT). In the inner current control loop is a passivity-based controller (PBC) designed to manage the three-phase PWM rectifier. Simulation results show that the controller design is effective and that the system exhibits satisfactory performance.
