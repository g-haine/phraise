## Abstract
This paper investigates the problem of position tracking control for joint robot systems. A sliding mode control method combined with Port-Controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) is introduced to cope with the chattering problem of joint robot systems only controlled by the sliding mode control scheme. Firstly, the mathematical model of robot system and permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive system are given in this paper. Then, the sliding mode control technique is utilized to design signal controllers for fast steady-state performance. And the PCH method is used for constructing energy controllers to decreasing energy losses. In addition, a coordination strategy is constructed to coordinate sliding mode control and PCH control for obtaining satisfactory control performance. Finally, the simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper.
