## Abstract
With the integration of wind energy, the widely used doubly fed induction generator wind turbines (DFIG-WT) could induce Power System forced oscillations (FOs), which threaten the safety of power grid. In this paper, an accurate FOs location method is proposed to pinpoint sources of FOs to the specific components inside a DFIG-WT and a participation assessment method is proposed to evaluate the role of DFIG-WTs in the FOs event. Firstly, the energy structure of the DFIG-WT is constructed and the correspondence between the physical components and energy structure of the DFIG-WT is established. Thus, the sources of FOs can be located by the energy flow among the converter, wind turbine and induction generator. Furthermore, the port-controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) method is used to analyze the influence of external disturbances to the potential energy of DFIG-WT, based on which the participation factor of the DFIG-WT in FOs event can be defined. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to locate the oscillation sources accurately and reveal the participation of the DFIG-WT in FOs events effectively.
