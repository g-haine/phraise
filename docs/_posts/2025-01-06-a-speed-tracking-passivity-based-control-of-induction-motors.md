## Abstract
In this work, the problem of speed tracking control for the Induction Motor (IM) is studied by implementing a Passivity Based Control (PBC) scheme for the Port Controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) mathematical model of the system. The first step of the implemented methodology is to analyze the model structure and exploit its properties to design a speed tracking control. The mathematical model used to design the speed tracking control is in the dq reference frame, where the stator electrical sinusoidal signals are transformed into constant signals. The importance of the contribution is embedded in the system inversion, as the IM has an electrical subsystem not completely actuated, which makes the control scheme implementation for the IM not a trivial result. For illustration purposes, the numerical evaluation was done by a MATLAB Simulink simulation that shows that the designed control is able to follow variant speed references.
