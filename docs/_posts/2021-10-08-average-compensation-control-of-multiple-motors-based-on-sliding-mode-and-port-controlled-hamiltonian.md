## Abstract
In multi-motor systems, the disturbances can affect the performance of the system, and the traditional connection structures of multiple motors have many shortcomings. This paper proposed a strategy of average compensation, firstly, the average speed of multiple motors is calculated, then, the speed of each motor is processed by averaging, finally, an active disturbance rejection controller is applied to compensate the current of each motor. For single motor, a sliding mode controller and a Port-Controlled Hamiltonian controller are designed respectively, and a disturbance observer is designed to observe the disturbances, which is applied to the feedforward compensation. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.
