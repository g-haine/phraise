## Abstract
A Current controller is always implemented as an inner loop in many DC-DC converters, to improve performance of the system. However, the variation of the load connected on the output degrades the whole system operation. In this paper, by using port-Hamiltonian system concept, the Energy Shaping technique and damping injection is utilized to remove load fluctuation from controller design process. In addition, the feedback and feedforward controller can be designed simultaneously, and both are combined in the developed controller. Therefore, the feedback loop becomes robust, and the disturbance rejection is enhanced. The simulation and experimental results on a 24V, 30W DC-DC buck-boost converter show the remarkable achievement of the proposed controller in command tracking and disturbance rejection.
