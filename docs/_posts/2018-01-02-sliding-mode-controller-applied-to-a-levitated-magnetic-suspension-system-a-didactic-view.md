## Abstract
Magnetic levitator is a challenging problem to address complex control systems in control teaching. In this paper the magnetic levitator model is synthetized using a Port Hamiltonian approach and with this model, an observed state gain feedback is tuned with a LQG technique. Then a SMC that used the observed state gain feedback in the sliding zone is developed, establishing the requirements for feedback stabilization. Results show that the system is able to stabilize the levitation sphere in a wider zone than the LQG control.
