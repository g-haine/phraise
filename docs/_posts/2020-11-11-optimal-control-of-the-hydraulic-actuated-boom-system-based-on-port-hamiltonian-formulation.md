## Abstract
The boom systems of mobile cranes and aerial platform vehicles are driven by hydraulic systems, to be specified, valve-controlled hydraulic cylinders. This hydraulic actuated boom system can accomplish the tasks such as lifting heavy loads or carrying personal to high position, by the design of a long boom structure. In practice, the boom structure is designed as light and slender as possible to control the structure self-weight. However, such structure is quite flexible and can be easily stimulated by the loads, including the driving force or torque from the hydraulic system. Our research focus es on trajectory planning for hydraulic actuated boom where both hydraulic driven system and boom structure deformation are considered. In this paper, the hydraulic actuated boom system is formulated as a port-Hamiltonian system which is a proper modelling method for multi-domain system. The problems of trajectory optimization and vibration control are formulated as optimal control problem based on port-Hamiltonian model and this procedure is tested on a model of hydraulic cylinder. A reasonable result is solved with the selected cost function and inputs.
