## Abstract
In this work, we describe an energy-based control method for under-actuated soft manipulators. The continuous dynamics of the soft robot are modeled by the differential geometry of Cosserat beams. Through a finite-dimensional truncation, a reduced port-Hamiltonian model is obtained that preserves desirable passivity conditions. Exploiting the passivity, we propose a stabilizing energy-shaping controller that ensures the potential energy is minimal at the desired end-effector configuration. Finally, the effectiveness of the energy-based controller is demonstrated through simulations of a soft manipulator inspired by the tentacle of an octopus.
