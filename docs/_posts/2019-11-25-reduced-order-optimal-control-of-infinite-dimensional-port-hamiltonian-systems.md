## Abstract
This paper deals with the reduced order controller design for infinite dimensional port Hamiltonian systems (IDPHS). Firstly, a structure preserving and passive LQG control design equivalent to Control by Interconnection is proposed. Based on this LQG controller, a structure preserving reduction method is used to approximate both the closed loop IDPHS and the LQG controller. This closed loop reduction guarantees that the reduced order controller will ensure acceptable closed loop performances on the infinite dimensional system. The proposed methods is applied to the control of a vibro-acoustic system.
