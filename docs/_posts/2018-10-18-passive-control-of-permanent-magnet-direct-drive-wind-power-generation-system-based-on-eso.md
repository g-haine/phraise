## Abstract
Considering the influence of internal parameter perturbation on the speed regulating performance of permanent magnet synchronous direct drive generator, the mathematical model of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Direct Drive Generator (PMSG) is studied from Hamiltonian energy and robustness. First, the mathematical model of port-controlled Hamiltonian system (PCHD) of PMSG system is deduced. Secondly, based on the principle of energy forming, PCHD and the extended state observer (ESO) technology, a passive current controller based on ESO is designed. In order to simplify the control algorithm and reduce the electromagnetic torque ripple, the system disturbance term is observed and compensated by ESO based on the inverse hyperbolic sine function. The simulation results show that this control method can ensure the stable operation of the system. It has strong speed tracking capability, load capability and robustness as well as has small electromagnetic torque ripple.
