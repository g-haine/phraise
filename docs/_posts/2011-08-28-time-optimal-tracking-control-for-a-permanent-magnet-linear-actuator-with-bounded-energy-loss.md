## Abstract
 This paper considers the tracking controller design for a mechatronic handling system. The presented approach is mainly based on Port-Hamiltonian systems and it has the intension to combine a feedforward controller with a state feedback controller in order to achieve good tracking behavior as well as good disturbance rejection for the controlled plant. The controller design is separated into several tasks. At first a passivity-based tracking controller is derived for the mathematical model. The IDA-PBC design leads also to a Lyapunov function for the stability analysis of the closed loop. In addition the feedback controller is combined with a flatness-based feedforward control law and one has to derive a desired trajectory for a differentially flat system, where the fictive output and the regulated output do not match. Furthermore some given technical and optimality limitations should be considered within the trajectory planning problem. This approach avoids the solution of a boundary value problem as well as a real-time integration of the internal dynamics.
