## Abstract
We study a class of non-autonomous boundary control and observation linear systems that are governed by non-autonomous multiplicative perturbations. This class is motivated by different fundamental partial differential equations, such as controlled wave equations and Timoshenko beams. Our main results give sufficient condition for well-posedness, existence and uniqueness of classical and mild solutions.
