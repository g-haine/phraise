## Abstract
This paper discusses model reduction of electrical circuits based on a port-Hamiltonian representation. It is shown that by the use Kalman decomposition an uncontrollable and/or unobservable system reduced to controllable/observable inherits structure. Energy and co-energy variable representations for systems are defined procedures used both representations. These exact motivate two approximate structure preserving general systems, one procedure called effort-constraint methods. The other under given condition. A numerical example illustrating ladder network as considered.
