## Abstract
Credible control and overall stabilization of closed-loop nonlinear systems presented in a port-controlled hamiltonian structure (PCH-D) were forever the development of the simultaneous interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (SIDA-PBC) method. The robustness and reliability of the method called into question against noise and certainly modelling errors. Indeed, a new scheme has been presented to control a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) based on the energy form and exploiting the electrical parameters of the closed loop system. The results obtained provide a new technique and implement more freedom when designing the diagram of the advanced controller during the production of active power. The contribution of this paper is researching on the advanced nonlinear methodes used, many simulations were carried out in simulation using the MATLAB/Simulink environment under important operating conditions, allowing to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method and verify the performance considering the robustness.
