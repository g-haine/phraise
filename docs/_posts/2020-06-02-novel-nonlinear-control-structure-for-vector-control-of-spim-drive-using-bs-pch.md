## Abstract
This paper presents a novel structure combining the port-controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) and Backstepping (BS) nonlinear control for the vector control of the six-phase induction motor (SPIM). In this new scheme, to improve the outer loopâ€™s robustness, the BS technique using the integral tracking errors action is proposed in the speed and flux controllers design. The advantage of this proposed control law is not to increase the complexity of differential equation resolution due to being not increased system states numbers. To enhance more the performance of SPIM drives (SPIMD), port-controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) scheme is used in the inner current loop controllers. In this proposed PCH current controller, the stabilization of controller is achieved via system passivity. In that, the interconnection and damping matrix functions of PCH system are shaped so that the physical (Hamiltonian) system structure is preserved at the closed loop level and the closed loop energy function is equal to the difference between the physical energy of the system and the energy supplied by the controller. The proposed control design is based on combination PCH and BS techniques improve significantly performance and robustness. The proposed speed control scheme is validated by Matlab-Simulink software.
