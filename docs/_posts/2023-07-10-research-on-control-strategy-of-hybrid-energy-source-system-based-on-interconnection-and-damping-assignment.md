## Abstract
In this paper, aiming at the nonlinear control problem of the hybrid energy source system, encompassing both the battery and the supercapacitor, an Interconnection and Damping Assignment Passivity-Based Control (IDA-PBC) strategy is proposed. Combined with modes charging and discharging modes, a port-controlled Hamiltonian mathematical model of the hybrid energy source system is established. By configuring the interconnection and damping matrices, an interconnection and damping assignment controller, incorporating the rule-based energy management strategy, is designed. When the load power demand changes, the designed controller can maintain the stability of the DC bus voltage and reasonably distribute the power between the battery and the supercapacitor. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.
