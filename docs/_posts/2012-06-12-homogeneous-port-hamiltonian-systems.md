## Abstract
In the previous two chapters we have formulated partial differential equations as  first order differential equations. Furthermore, we described the solutions of these differential equations via a strongly continuous semigroup. These differential equations were only weakly connected to the norm of the underlying state space. However, in this chapter we consider a class of differential equations for which there is a very natural state space norm. This natural choice enables us to show that the corresponding semigroup is a contraction semigroup.
