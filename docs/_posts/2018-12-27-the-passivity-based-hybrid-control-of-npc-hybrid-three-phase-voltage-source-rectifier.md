## Abstract
For the purpose of improving the performance of traditional unidirectional hybrid three phase voltage source rectifier (UHTPVSR), the neutral point clamped (NPC) hybrid rectifier is proposed in this paper. The energy of the NPC hybrid rectifier can flow in both directions, the total harmonic distortion (THD) is lower, and the converter capacity is larger. The port controlled hamiltonian with dissipation (PCHD) mathematical models of the Boost converter and the NPC rectifier are built respectively, and the passivity-based hybrid control (PBHC) controller is designed, which includes the outer voltage loop based on proportional-integral (PI) control and the inner current loop based on passivity based control. The designed control strategy is with better current tracking performance, output voltage stablity, and good robustness. The simulation model is established by MATLAB/Simulink, and the simulation results show good static and dynamic performances of the proposed control strategy.
