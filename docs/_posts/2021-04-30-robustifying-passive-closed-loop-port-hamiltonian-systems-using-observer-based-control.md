## Abstract
This paper contributes a passivity-based approach to obtain a control law that robustifies Port-Hamiltonian (pH) control systems under external and state-dependent disturbances using disturbance observers (DO). A twostage design procedure is used to define the Disturbance Observed Based Control (DOBC) scheme. In the first stage a passivity based control law, called Interconnection and Damping assignment (IDA-PBC) is designed in the Bond Graph (BG) domain via BG prototyping, using an undisturbed model of the physical system. This stage is not the main issue of this paper and therefore the IDA-PBC law will be assumed to be known. The second stage, the main result of this paper, consists in the design of the DO and its integration with the IDA-PBC control law. The DO is derived in the BG domain via the integration of the residual signal computed from a Diagnostic Bond Graph (DBG). The methodology is developed through examples in the BG domain and formalized and extended in the pH framework.
