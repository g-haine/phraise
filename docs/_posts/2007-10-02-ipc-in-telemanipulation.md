## Abstract
In this chapter a general setting for telemanipulation of Port Control Hamiltonian systems has been presented. A new system theoretic condition has been introduced which can be used to test if proper matching is taking place. A possible measure of matching has been also introduced. It has been shown that the standard form of explicit port controlled Hamiltonian systems is not general enough to obtain matching and it must be extended by a feed-throw term. This can be shown more generally using directly a network structure as shown in Sect. 6.4.1. The presented theory is important for the implementation of geometrical telemanipulation where the vector space used se (3) does not have an internal product.
