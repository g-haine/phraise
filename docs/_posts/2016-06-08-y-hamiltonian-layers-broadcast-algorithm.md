## Abstract
Anew approach to broadcast in wormhole routed three-dimensional networks is proposed. One of the most important process in communication and parallel computer is broadcast approach.. The approach of this case of Broadcasting is to send the message from one source to all destinations in the network which corresponds to one-to-all communication. Wormhole routing is a fundamental routing mechanism in modern parallel computers which is characterized with low communication latency. We show how to apply this approach to 3-D meshes. Wormhole routing is divided the packets into set of FLITS (flow control digits). The first Flit of the packet (Header Flit) is containing the destination address and all subsets flits will follow the routing way of the header Flit. In this paper, we consider an efficient algorithm for broadcasting on an all-port wormhole-routed 3D mesh with arbitrary size. We introduce an efficient algorithm, Y-Hamiltonian Layers Broadcast(Y-HLB). In this paper the behaviors of this algorithm were compared to the previous results, our paradigm reduces broadcast latency and is simpler. In this paper our simulation results show the average of our proposed algorithm over the other algorithms that presented.
