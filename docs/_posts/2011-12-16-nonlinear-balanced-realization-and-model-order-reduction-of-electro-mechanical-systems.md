## Abstract
This paper proposes a model order reduction procedure based on nonlinear balanced truncation which preserves the port-Hamiltonian structure of the original model. This method allows us to preserve the energy variable which will be useful in controlling the reduced order model. Furthermore, a numerical simulation shows how the proposed method works.
