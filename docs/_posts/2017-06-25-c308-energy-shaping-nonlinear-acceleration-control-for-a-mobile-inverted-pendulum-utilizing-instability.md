## Abstract
A nonlinear controller for accelerating a mobile inverted pendulum (MIP) with interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC) is proposed. For underactuated systems, partial differential equations (PDEs) must be solved to derive the IDA-PBC it difficult task in general. However, this study shows that MIP can properly described as full actuated port-Hamiltonian system focusing only on dynamics. The derived without solving PDEs. Although our part of system, translational acceleration indirectly controlled utilizing relation between inclination arising from instability system. realize various properties through energy shaping procedure IDA-PBC. Especially an function which will lead safe operation proposed study. ensures motion restricted predefined region converges desired angle. also gets back angle large state-dependent gain when comes close fall over. Effectiveness verified simulations.
