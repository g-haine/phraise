## Abstract
For linear dynamical systems (in continuous-time and discrete-time), we revisit and extend the concepts of hypocoercivity and hypocontractivity and give a detailed analysis of the relations of these concepts to (asymptotic) stability, as well as (semi-)dissipativity and (semi-)contractivity, respectively. On the basis of these results, the short-time behavior of the propagator norm for linear continuous-time and discrete-time systems is characterized by the (shifted) hypocoercivity index and the (scaled) hypocontractivity index, respectively.
