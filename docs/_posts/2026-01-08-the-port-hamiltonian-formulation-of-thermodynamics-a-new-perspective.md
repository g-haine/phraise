## Abstract
This paper proposes a change in the traditional epistemological paradigm and a look at classical thermodynamics from the point of view of control theory, with the aim of discovering energy state variables. The paper proposes a transition from “causality” to “purposefulness” in nature, which is called port-Hamiltonian thermodynamics. It is unclear whether classical thermodynamics can be incorporated into the formalism of port-Hamiltonian field theory, and it is likely that thermodynamics will need to be expanded or even completely reformulated. The main goal is to satisfy the First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics a priori.
