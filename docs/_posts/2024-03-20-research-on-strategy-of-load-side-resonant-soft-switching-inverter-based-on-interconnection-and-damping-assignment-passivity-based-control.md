## Abstract
Soft-switching technologies can effectively solve the problem of switching losses caused by increasing switching frequency of grid-connected inverters. As a branch of soft-switching technologies, load-side resonant soft-switching is a hotspot for applications of high-frequency inverters, because it has the advantage of achieving soft-switching without using additional components. However, the traditional PI control strategy based on the linear model is prone to destabilization and non-robust dynamic performance when large signal perturbation occurs. In this paper, a novel Passivity-Based Control (PBC) method is proposed to improve the dynamic performance of load-side resonant soft-switching grid-connected inverter. Besides, the model based on the Port Controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) model of the soft switching inverter is carried out, and the passivity-based controller is designed based on the established model using the way of interconnection and damping assignmentpassivity based control (IDA-PBC). Both stable performance and dynamic performance of the load-side resonant soft-switching inverter can be improved over the whole operating range. Finally, a 750 W load-side resonant soft-switching inverter simulation model is built and the output performance is compared with the traditional PI control strategy under stable and dynamic conditions. The simulation results show that the proposed control strategy reduces the harmonic distortion rate and improves the quality of the output waveforms.
