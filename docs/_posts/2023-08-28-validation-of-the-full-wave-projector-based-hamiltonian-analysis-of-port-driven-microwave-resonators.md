## Abstract
Quantum information processing technologies are gaining interest due to their potential for performance exceeding what is possible with the best classical computers. One of the most promising platforms is the circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architecture that controls superconducting circuit qubits by coupling them to electromagnetic fields in microwave resonators or waveguides. As these devices become increasingly complex, existing analysis and design approaches that often rely on lumped element circuit approximations can become inadequate due to their lack of accuracy and flexibility. This is leading to a growing interest in developing quantum full-wave numerical modeling methods for the high-fidelity analysis of cQED devices. In this work, we focus on a quantum full-wave modeling approach that uses a projector-based quantization approach that allows a problem to be decomposed into distinct subdomains whose fields can be quantized more easily. This leads to a framework that can naturally incorporate microwave ports, which is not straightforward with other formulations. Here, we consider an explicit problem of a coaxial-fed rectangular waveguide cavity to validate parts of our projector-based formalism. Toward this end, we apply this approach to a classical Hamiltonian analysis of this system that can be used to more easily validate the relevant full-wave aspects of the corresponding quantum formulation. In addition to presenting the formulation of the full-wave classical Hamiltonian of the system, we derive equations of motion and discuss an analytical solution procedure with an input-output theory approach. We validate our formulation by comparing the input-output theory results to standard finite element method (FEM) scattering parameter simulations.
