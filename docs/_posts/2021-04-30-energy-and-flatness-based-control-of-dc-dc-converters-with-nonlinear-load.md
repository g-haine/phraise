## Abstract
This paper presents a passivity-based controller design (PBC) aimed at stabilizing DC-DC power electronic converters with nonlinear dissipative loads. The converters considered in this work are the buck, the boost and the buck-boost. First, Bond Graph technique is used to obtain the flat output of each converter model. The controller is designed within the port-Hamiltonian (pH) framework, ensuring stability and other desired closed-loop properties. To this aim a desired closedloop dynamics in pH form with a quadratic storage function and a flat-output-inspired change of variables are proposed, which are common to the three converters. The controllers that render the closed-loop dynamics in the desired pH form are obtained via model matching. This design has two major advantages. The first is that the so-called matching equation can be solved by construction; thus, the cumbersome task of solving partial differential equations is avoided. The second advantage is that in all the converters treated the closed-loop dynamics is linear; thus, the performance of the control system can be easily determined via the tuning of the eigenvalues of the closed-loop evolution matrix. The performance is assessed through digital simulation.
