## Abstract
to control function which compensate this positive value by the difference between the SC voltage and its reference. We are in discharging mode. After the load variation (t > 1.5 s), the current in the DC link became equal to the load current. The SC current I SC became null. We have a small variation in the batteries currents. in the of
