## Abstract
Micro-grids, which utilize photo-voltaic (PV) cells, wind turbines, and batteries, are gaining widespread adoption as a viable solution for renewable and sustainable energy infrastructures. However, ensuring the reliability and stability of these power grids is critical, and several control strategies have been developed to achieve these goals. In this study, we have modeled the decentralized behavior of microgrids using the port-Hamiltonian formulation and a PI controller to control the inverter voltage and output power. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our control method, we have conducted simulations that consider both maximum and worst-case system fluctuations.
