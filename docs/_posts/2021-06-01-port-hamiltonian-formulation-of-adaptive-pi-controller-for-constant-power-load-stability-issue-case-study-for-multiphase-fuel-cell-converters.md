## Abstract
The cascaded connection of converters in dc microgrid may cause instability due to the fact that converters performing as loads have a constant power load (CPL) behaviors. In this article, the construction of the feedback controller of a multiphase interleaved fuel cell (FC) boost converter is based on the adaptive Hamiltonian–PI control law, including an integral terms in order to guarantee that there is no steady-state error in the important dc bus voltage. The control approach is authenticated via digital simulations and experimental prototyping with a 2500 W FC converter supplied by a FC/reformer size 2500 W, 50 V.
