## Abstract
In this paper, energy-shaping theory-based passivity controller is designed for boost converter feeding constant power load. To regulate the average output voltage indirectly, Passivity based controllers namely Euler-Lagrange and Port-controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) controllers are implemented. Design of these controllers is carried out following an ‘energy shaping and damping injection’ scheme. A mathematical modeling of proposed system along with controllers is carried out under steady state condition. A Simulink model of boost converter rated for 20 W, 48V is developed and aforesaid passivity based controllers are implemented. Based on simulation study, performances of these controllers are investigated under various operating conditions. The robustness of the proposed controller is investigated against source and load variations.
