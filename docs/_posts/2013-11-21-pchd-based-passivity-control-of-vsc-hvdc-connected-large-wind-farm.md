## Abstract
Concentrated integration of large scale wind power demands stronger robustness of VSC-HVDC transmission. Based on PCHD (Port Controled Hamiltonian with Dissipation) equation, the PCHD model of voltage source converter (VSC) in abc frame and d-q rotating frame are built and the strict passivity of VSC is proved. Desired energy function is constructed and used as Lyapunov function by assigning link matrix and damping matrix. Impact from VSC equivalent dc resistance is eliminated by additional damping matrix. The IDA-PB (Interconnection and Damping Assignment Passivity-based) controller is designed based on desired equilibrium point and state variable. With different operation conditions, VSC-HVDC and its control system are simulated by software PSCAD/EMTDC, the results show the proposed control strategy has good performance and strong robustness.
