## Abstract
This contribution is about the nonlinear controller design for power converters based on Port-Hamiltonian systems. Due to the high-frequency pulse width modulation we consider a so called average model for the power converter, which is the basis for the model-based controller design. It is the goal to derive a nonlinear control law for the DC/DC converter in order to achieve the desired output voltage. Furthermore an integral controller is added to guarantee a vanishing output error. The Port-Hamiltonian approach leads to a control law as well as a Lyapunov function for the closed loop stability analysis. In this contribution we consider a simple buck converter example and the Cuk power converter. The energy-based controllers are easy to implement and the included measurements of the Cuk converter are convincing.
