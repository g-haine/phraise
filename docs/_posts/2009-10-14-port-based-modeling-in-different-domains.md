## Abstract
In this Chapter we present some detailed examples of modelling in several domains using port and port-Hamiltonian concepts, as have been presented in the previous chapters. We start with the electromechanical domain in Sect. 3.1, while in Sect. 3.2 it is shown how port-Hamiltonian systems can be fruitfully used for the structured modelling of robotics mechanisms. In Sect. 3.3, it is show how to model simple elastic systems either in the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian framework, while, in Sect. 3.4, an expressions of the models representing momentum, heat and mass transfer as well as chemical reactions within homogeneous fluids in the port-based formalism is proposed. To this end, the entropy balance and the associated source terms are systematically written in accordance with the principle of irreversible thermodynamics. Some insights are also given concerning the constitutive equations and models allowing to calculate transport and thermodynamic properties. As it will be shown, for each physical domain, these port-based models can be translated into bond-graph models, in the case of distributed as well as lumped parameters models.
