## Abstract
The mathematical model of Three-phase voltage sources Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) DC/AC inverter is nonlinear, in view of the traditional linear control strategy can not meet the requirements of designing high-performance inverter. What's more, when the loads will be not pure resistive load, the inverter further requires controller possess high-performance. This paper proposes a nonlinear control strategy for the inverter called Passivity-based Control. We can alter the inverter model in three-phase abc coordinate to two-phase synchronous rotating dq coordinate for establishing the Port Control Hamiltonian (PCHD) model for this system. We can control the distribution of energy in the system to achieve the control aim. Simulation results show that passivity-based control method can make this system possess the high-performance of robustness and dynamic.
