This site is a **bibliographic survey** dedicated to research on **port-Hamiltonian systems**. The goal is to provide a **collection of papers** to help researchers stay informed about the latest advancements, identify potential research gaps, and foster collaborations.

The site is **updated at regular intervals** to reflect newly published works.

## **How to Contribute?**
Contributions are welcome in the form of **DOI submissions**. You can:
- Submit a **pull request** with new DOIs in the `newDOI.txt` file on the project's [**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/g-haine/phraise).
- Send [**an email**](mailto:ghislain.haine@isae.fr?subject=%5BPHRAISE%5D) with a list of new DOIs.

**Automated contributions are not possible** due to API rate limitations. The metadata compilation will be manually performed before each update, but the site itself is automatically rebuilt with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) after each push.

## **Scope & Methodology**

### **Why DOIs?**
Maintaining a large database manually is challenging. To ensure a sustainable and (almost) automated process, we **restrict** this survey to **published works with a DOI**. This guarantees easy updates and avoids manually managing metadata.

While the scripts used for collecting metadata are **publicly available** on the [**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/g-haine/phraise), they will primarily be run by the site maintainer.

### **Data Sources**
The metadata is retrieved using a hierarchical approach using the following APIs:
1. [**CrossRef**](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/) and [**DOI Foundation**](https://www.doi.org/doi-handbook/HTML/doi-rest-api.html): primary sources, ensuring completeness of minimal metadata;
2. [**Scopus**](https://dev.elsevier.com/documentation/SCOPUSSearchAPI.wadl): for abstracts and keywords, when available via Elsevier;
3. [**Springer Meta API**](https://dev.springernature.com/docs/api-endpoints/meta-api/): for abstracts and keywords from Springer;
4. [**OpenAlex**](https://docs.openalex.org/how-to-use-the-api/api-overview) & [**Semantic Scholar**](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api): as fallback sources for missing abstracts and keywords.

Currently, **only metadata and abstracts** are collected: **full texts are not included**.

The resulting database is [available for download]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/data/biblio.json) (a JSON file).

### **arXiv**
To stay as up to date as possible, we use the [arXiv API](https://info.arxiv.org/help/api/user-manual.html) to retrieve the latest preprints related to port-Hamiltonian systems.

However, since these preprints have not been peer-reviewed or officially published, they do not have DOIs registered in **CrossRef**. For this reason, **arXiv** entries are displayed on a separate page. These entries are dynamically fetched and are not part of the **PHRAISE** internal database. As a result, they are not included in the [search tool]({{ site.baseurl }}/search/).

### **Handling Author's names**
The [Author pages]({{ site.baseurl }}/authors/) need a management to take care of the different ways an author can appear in a publication. This can be a source of errors, so please do not hesitate to [suggest corrections](mailto:ghislain.haine@isae.fr?subject=%5BPHRAISE%5D). You may want to take a look at [the array managing name variations]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/data/author_mappings.json) (a JSON file).

### **Curation Process**
No additional **peer review** is conducted; the survey relies on **CrossRef's metadata**, assuming that all indexed works have already undergone editorial scrutiny.
