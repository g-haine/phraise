# PHRAISE
Port-Hamiltonian Representation and Approximation of Interconnected Systems for Everything

The project PHRAISE aims at presenting the port-Hamiltonian framework for the modelling, the discretization and the control of physical systems.

Its ambition is to provide a lecture notes, an up-to-date bibliography and some jupyter notebooks for training, all about port-Hamiltonian systems in a wide range of applications, with several points of view.
